# **v4.0**

This document outlines the changes from the DefinitiveSpec Agent Context. This version represents a fundamental architectural evolution, transforming the agent from a powerful "implementer" into a true "strategic partner."

### **Summary: From Rule-Follower to Proactive Partner**

The agent's core has been rebuilt. It now operates with **full project awareness**, maintaining an in-memory index of all specifications. This enables deep, strategic analysis and impact assessment previously impossible. Its behavior is no longer governed by a simple list of rules but by a predictable, stateful **Operational Lifecycle**, making every action more intelligent, transparent, and safe.

### **üöÄ Key Architectural Changes**

*   **Stateful Operational Lifecycle:** Replaced the flat list of `methodology_rule`s with a mandatory 5-phase lifecycle (`Sync`, `Focus`, `Analyze`, `Execute`, `Refine`). This provides a predictable and robust foundation for all agent operations.
*   **Project Index & Transactional Focus:** The agent now bootstraps by creating an in-memory index of the entire project. This "big picture" view is used for high-level analysis, while all modifications are executed within a safe, validated "transactional focus."
*   **Privileged Architectural Profiles:** Formalized the concept of project-specific `Architectural Profile` files. These are loaded in a privileged context to safely extend the agent's core patterns and knowledge without compromising the secure user-facing parser.

### **‚ú® Added: New Capabilities & Commands**

#### **Strategic & Generative Commands**
*   `Analyze Impact of Change...`: Leverage the Project Index to perform a reverse dependency lookup and generate a detailed report on the ripple effects of a proposed change *before* it's made.
*   `Explore Idea...`: A powerful product-discovery tool that takes a vague concept and generates three distinct `requirement` hypotheses (e.g., MVP, Core, Ambitious) to guide strategic planning.
*   `Analyze Production Report...`: Bridge the gap between spec and reality. The agent can now ingest an operator-provided data file (e.g., from monitoring tools) and compare it against `kpi` targets, highlighting discrepancies.

#### **Analysis & Refactoring Commands**
*   `Distill Pattern from...`: Makes system evolution a first-class, explicit command. The Operator can now point to a piece of logic and guide the agent to abstract it into a new, reusable architectural pattern.
*   `Analyze Spec Quality...`: A dedicated "linter" for DSpec files that analyzes a spec's complexity and cohesion and provides actionable refactoring suggestions for the spec itself.
*   `Generate Diagram...`: Instantly generate Mermaid diagrams (`sequence`, `dependency`, etc.) from DSpec artifacts for visual documentation and analysis.

#### **Proactive Analysis Modules**
*   **`StrategicAdvisor`:** Before execution, this module validates that a spec's implementation (`detailed_behavior`) is logically aligned with the business `rationale` of its requirement.
*   **`DataFlowSecurityAnalyzer`:** A new guardrail that traces the flow of data marked with `pii_category` and issues critical warnings if it's routed to an insecure sink (like a generic `LOG`).

#### **Specification Language Enhancements**
*   **Reusable Test Data (`stub`):** Introduced a first-class `stub` artifact for defining version-controlled data payloads. `test` specs can now reference these stubs, creating a canonical, reusable source for test data and mocks.
*   **Advanced Concurrency:** The `detailed_behavior` language now supports modern concurrency primitives like `PARALLEL` and `RACE`, enabling expressive modeling of complex asynchronous flows.
*   **Pinpoint Test Traceability:** `test` specs can now link directly to a specific `interaction.step` or `behavior.transition`, providing hyper-granular verification.

### **üîÑ Changed: Evolving the Core Experience**

*   **From Enforcer to Partner:** Rigid `HALT` instructions have been replaced with an interactive `[PAUSE] RECOMMENDATION` protocol. The agent now presents its findings and suggests a path forward, empowering the Operator with the final decision while maintaining methodological rigor.
*   **Improved Test-Driven Protocol:** The `Implement Code Spec` command now enforces a strict **Test-First** workflow: 1) Generate `test` spec, 2) Get Operator approval, 3) Implement code to satisfy the approved tests.
*   **User-Driven Learning Loop:** The agent's learning capability is no longer just a passive suggestion. It is now an explicit, operator-driven process triggered by the `Distill Pattern from...` command.
*   **Safer Refactoring:** The `Refactor...` command is now smarter. For patterns marked with `impact_analysis_scope: 'full_project'`, it **must** first run `Analyze Impact of Change...` and require explicit Operator confirmation before proceeding.

### **üõ°Ô∏è Security & Stability**

*   **Sandboxed Grammar:** The EBNF parser for user-provided `.dspec` files is now a secure, unprivileged grammar. It strictly forbids system-level keywords (`schema`, `pattern`, etc.), preventing injection attacks and ensuring user specs operate within a safe sandbox.
*   **Refactoring Guardrails:** The mandatory impact analysis for wide-scope refactoring adds a critical layer of stability, preventing unintended consequences from large-scale automated changes.
*   **Logical Soundness:** All internal contradictions from previous versions have been resolved. The v4.0 context is a logically sound and coherent instruction set, providing a more reliable and predictable agent.
